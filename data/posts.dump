Look at the way the computer industry, the telecom industry and the entertainment/ industrial complex has worked to limit our choices, roll back our access to new technologies, and lock us in to carefully controlled uses of their products. Equipment is hamstrung, demand is ignored, products are made less friendly to the user but more friendly to the profit margins. While trumpeting technological advances, they ship products that don\'t work or don\'t work well. There is outright hostility to those of us who are the ones pumping money into these industries. The entire model of supply and demand/free market is turned on its head and WE become the consumables.\r\n\r\nI don\'t want to make too big a jump here for those of you who are happy as clams as long as you can go to the best buy and get a 52\" something that sets you back a month\'s pay, just to find that it can\'t do the things you really want it to do because those features are \"just around the corner\". The next release, the coming upgrade, THAT\'s the one you really want. But this fundamental change in the flow of power from the consumer to industry is being mirrored in the realm of public life. Politics are no longer about us. Elections are held but voters are optional. With all the things happening in the world, all the stories that could be told, every single media outlet has the same half-dozen stories on the front page. I used to wonder why some insignificant event would suddenly show up as the most important story in every single newspaper and news show. Now it becomes clear: as long as there\'s something to show us, it doesn\'t matter if it\'s the things that matter. As long as we watch. As long as we consume, as long as we pay, and most important, as long as we get up to go to work tomorrow so we can keep making those credit card payments.\r\n\r\nI\'m sorry that I\'m making these big jumps from this rather unsurprising story about one company doing something to hurt another.

Chicken tastes alot like itself. Chicken is the most versatile tool in the universe. Chicken is amazing. Chicken ownz j00. Chicken kicks your ass. Chicken has mad skills. Chicken McNuggets from Mcdonalds suck hairy grandma ass, but Chicken Nuggets from Wendy\'s Rule the World.\r\n\r\nI also like to get a Junior Bacon Cheeseburger with No Mayonnaise from Wendy\'s. I hate mayonnaise. Mayonnaise is  evil. Mayonnaise is so evil that it will grow hair if you leave it out in the sun for 1 hour, start to talk after 2 hours, and try to take over the world in 4. We must stop all the mayonnaise from   taking over the world. I\'m a member of the anti-mayonnaise club. Mayonnaise sucks ass. Chicken kicks Mayonnaise\'s ass. If there were a celebrity deathmatch between Chicken, and Mayonnaise, Chicken would definitely own Mayonnaise. Probably, the Chicken would rip off the mayonnaise\'s top, and pour the Mayonnaise down the sink.\r\n\r\nIf you think Mayonnaise is wonderful, like my friend Shahram, who eats Mayonnaise by  the tablespoon, you can  come over to  my house and I  can kick your fucking  ass. Shahram is  a stupid Iraqi.  He has a  big nose, and  a big Adam\'s apple. Chicken is tasty.\r\n\r\nChicken should  rule the world. If chicken  ruled the world, I  would bow down before Chicken.  When Chicken rules the  world, I\'m sure  Chicken will destroy all  Mayonnaise. I  once  found  a fried Chicken  head in  a  box of  Chicken Mcnuggets. The only reason I bought a box of Chicken Mcnuggets was because the nearest Wendy\'s  was about 60 miles  away. I was  in Idaho. Idaho is  a stupid place. Toronto is another  stupid place. Once I got lost in  Toronto and I had to stay at a different hotel than the one I was staying at, in order to get to the one I  was staying at. I was staying at the Holiday Inn, and  in order to find the Holiday Inn  I had to stay in the shitty  Novotel next to the airport for 2 days.\r\n\r\nCanada is also stupid. When I went  to Canada, there was no Dr. Pepper. Canada is basically England,  but French, and Big, and just North  of the US. England was fun. It was more fun than Canada,  except for when I fell down the 3 story building when the London punk pushed me. I got £200 from that asshole after he pushed  me so  that I  wouldn\'t press  charges. I  couldn\'t, anyway,  \'cause I wasn\'t a citizen. I learned how to row a rowboat in England.\r\n\r\nThere is  no Iced  Tea in England,  so I  was very depressed  when I  was over there. Everyone says Colour instead of  Color, and Cheque instead of Check. In Scotland no one wears underwear.\r\n\r\nDo you know what a Scotsman keeps under his kilt? His family jewels. I learned that from a tour guide in scotland. The tour guide was like 900 years old, and a veteran of the Scottish revolution.  He smelled like that odor removal stuff that smells like shit itself.\r\n\r\nIn England  everything costs what it would  cost here in dollars,  except in £ and in  metric system.  Gas was  like £2.25 per  Liter, which  is like  $8 per gallon. That\'s why  no one ever drives  in England, but traffic is  so bad. In Canada milk comes in a bag.\r\n\r\nThe  baked potatoes from  Wendy\'s suck.  Once I  was eating  at a  Shoney\'s in Tennessee, and  I ordered  this mozzarella Chicken  sandwich. It took  like 30 minutes to make, and when it came,  it was like boiling, and it burnt the roof of my mouth..
